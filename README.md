PREJAVA INFO
----------------------------

NOTE: OPTIFINE IS NOT REQUIRED. Too many people rely on Optifine for their texture packs to work properly. for me, it just lags my computer more than ever. The screenshots do not use Optifine, but a few little extra things have been put in for those who do!

PreJava is a texture pack for the current versions of Minecraft that recreates the nostalgic feel of the game from classic to 1.6.2! It's inspired by NostalgiCraft, but is more accurate than that! Many textures have been recreated by scratch due to missing versions, and the water being coded in before 1.5. Water was a pain to recreate!


PreJava uses the original textures from early versions of the game, along with heavily modified JSON files to give it that extra accuracy, such as the way items were originally held and the squished items in the classic versions.

Included in the pack's zip file are addons that can be put on over top of PreJava itself. These addons provide easy customizable experience with the texture pack itself. Many addons provide small changes, such as "Classic Grass" if the Cave Game grass doesnt look good to you. In fact, the texture pack without addons results in every texture being the first of its kind, meaning all entities, items, and blocks showing up as it was when it was first created.

Not all addons are small though, the big feature is the "version addons". These are special because of their emulation and look of a specific Minecraft version. The following versions addons included are:

-Pocket Edition Alpha 0.5.0
-Classic 0.0.20a
-Beta 1.5
-Release 1.6.2

To use addons, place the addon you want (inside the PreJava zip or folder) into the resource pack folder WITH PreJava, then select it ingame so its on top of PreJava 1.2.

By the way, I've been hiding easter eggs and callbacks within the files of the texture pack! Such as Herobrine and unused items! I hope you find them all!

If you have any suggestions or ideas, please feel free to comment below! This pack will be updated alot, so feedback is very good!

A: This Texture comes with "mini packs" inside! The "EXTRAS" folder contains some that you can place into your "resourcepacks" folder and have them act like an add-on! This includes the "Alpha Grass" add-on!
