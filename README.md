PREJAVA INFO
----------------------------
Thank you for downloading Omniarchive's PreJava Texture Pack!

This texture pack uses first variants of assets (ranging through MANY versions of the game) and uses them to create this Texture Pack! Think of it as "Minecraft: Un-updated Textures Edition!" 

Everything in this texture pack was either recreated, ripped, or made to fit in with the older textures of minecraft. For example, the Oak Door and Oak Trapdoor use the same colorscheme as the original Wooden Planks. 

Everything else though is pretty much as accurate as I can get it! Look it up! 

If you have any ideas (or more inportantly: BUG FIXES..), please contact me below!

Q: I prefer the newer grass with the dirt on the sides!
______________________________
A: This Texture comes with "mini packs" inside! The "EXTRAS" folder contains some that you can place into your "resourcepacks" folder and have them act like an add-on! This includes the "Alpha Grass" add-on!
